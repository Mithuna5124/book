# Book Recommender System

A web-based application that helps users discover books through both **popular suggestions** and **personalized recommendations**, built with **Python, Pandas, and Streamlit**.

---

## Features

*  **Popular Books**: See what's trending among readers.
*  **Personalized Recommendations**: Get suggestions based on your interests.
*  **Content & Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes both basic and advanced recommender techniques.
*  **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use Streamlit interface for seamless user interaction.

##  Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Python, Pandas
* **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit
* **Data Handling**: CSV/structured datasets of books and user interactions
* **Recommendation Algorithms**:

  * Popularity-based filtering
  * Content-based filtering
  * Collaborative filtering (optional/advanced)

├── books.csv             # Dataset with book details
├── ratings.csv           # Dataset with user ratings
├── users.csv             # User metadata (if available)

##  How It Works

* **Popular Books Tab**: Displays top-rated books based on average ratings and number of votes.
* **Personalized Recommendations Tab**: User selects a book they like, and the system suggests similar books using vector similarity or rating correlations.
